# dnavarro's Hy utilities and macros

This repository holds assorted Hy macros and functions I've written for my own use. It's unclear that anyone else would use them, but if it's worth version controlling closely, it's worth publishing on Github, I figure.


It is heavily inspired by [Kodhy](https://github.com/Kodiologist/Kodhy). Some functions actually assume that Kodhy is installed, and therefore the latest (master branch) version of Hy.

Since these are written after looking very closely at Kodhy (enough that I'm not comfortable claiming originality), the code is copy-lefted (GPL v3).
