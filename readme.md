# dnavarro's Hy utilities and macros

This repository holds assorted Hy macros and functions I'm writing for my own use. They're mainly published to Github so I can use and develop them both at work and at home without otherwise mixing proprietary and personal, free-to-use code. You're welcome to them, but as standard free software licenses go: no warranty of suitability for purpose etc. 


It is heavily inspired by [Kodhy](https://github.com/Kodiologist/Kodhy). Some functions actually assume that Kodhy is installed, and therefore the latest (master branch) version of Hy.
